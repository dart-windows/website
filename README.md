# Website

This repo contains the documentation for the Dart | Windows packages, which is
hosted on GitHub Pages at https://win32.pub.

The content is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
For more details, consult the Docusaurus documentation.

### Deployment

The documentation is automatically updated on every successful commit
to `main` with a GitHub Action, which compiles and deploys new content
to the website at https://win32.pub.
